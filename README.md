## Usage
#### 1. Chat with your chemical library, e.g. Drugbank
Powered by [AI/BI Genie](https://www.databricks.com/product/business-intelligence/ai-bi-genie) to generate text-to-SQL to query your chemical library

#### 2. Search [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) via [PUG REST API](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-rest)
Supports exact/substructure/superstructure search by SMILES, name, CID
